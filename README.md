# This repository is for OPL @ RoboCup 2024. 

# Supervised by Prof. Qijun Chen and Prof. Chengju Liu @ Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Lab (RAIL), Tongji University.


This repository is comprised of the following parts:

1. Machine Vision Methods on Ubuntu Platform (you can read about them in my course paper at another repository "IPMV 2024").

2. Source code of Gesture recognition.

3. Source code of Coordinate Transformation.

4. To be updated.


In the commemorative issue celebrating the 40th anniversary of ROBOTICA, the international flagship journal of robotics, Editor-in-Chief Prof. ***Jian S. Dai*** analyzed in his editor's note that the development of robotics can be divided into two 25-year periods: the first 25 years (1985-2010) being the period of rapid development of industrial robots, such as factory assembly line robots; while **service robots** and **medical robots** were still in their initial and start-up stages. The next 25 years (2010-2035) will see the rapid development of service robots and medical robots. Through my practice @ **RAIL**, I will learn and participate in the work related to service robots and also accumulate technical experience for **the future realization of automation in hospitals**.
